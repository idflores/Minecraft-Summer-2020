# FTB Infinity Evolved - Square Crafters Edition

Just FTB Infinity Evolved with some periodic updates for my friends and I!

## Patch Notes

#### v1.1

- [x] Added Ztones v2.2.1 from [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ztones/files/2223720)

- [x] Modified Ztones config and disabled items from mod to keep in the "spirit" of the modpack (removed Ofanix, Splat Axe, Terrain Eater, Totem Tool)

- [x] Modified Simply Jetpacks config to move jetpack status GUI from top-left to bottom-right of screen and keep from conflicting with Thaumcraft wand GUI


#### v1.0c

**iChunUtil** - Huge thanks to @RedstoneTek for patching iChunUtil to work with the new FTB Infinity Evolved update. The problem is a new URL requirement to HTTPS preventing iChunUtil from downloading hats from CDNs. Go [here](https://github.com/RedstoneTek/HatsDownloader) to fix the problem.


## TODO

- [x] Add ReAuth mod for automatic client session handling
