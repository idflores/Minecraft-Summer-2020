# FTB Infinity Evolved - Square Crafters Edition

Just FTB Infinity Evolved with some periodic updates for my friends and I!

## Patch Notes

**iChunUtil** - Huge thanks to @RedstoneTek for patching iChunUtil to work with the new FTB Infinity Evolved update. The problem is a new URL requirement to HTTPS preventing iChunUtil from downloading hats from CDNs. Go [here](https://github.com/RedstoneTek/HatsDownloader) to fix the problem.

## TODO
[] Add ReAuth mod for automatic client session handling
